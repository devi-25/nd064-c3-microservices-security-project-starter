How will you test the changes?
The modification will undergo testing in a non-production setting, such as a test cluster.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
After implementing the change, it is essential to employ our observability and monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to track relevant metrics. This process should be tested in a non-production cluster to ensure its effectiveness.
